#Vehicle Registration Check Testing



The module checks the vehicle registration from an excel document and vehicle details with the data from
the DVLA website. 

It uses the directory Directory=C://Users//User//workspace//vehicleRegCheck//src//DirectoryForScanning//

The above Directory config is set in config.properties.

Before running the project please change the location of the above config to the workspace 
that is having the DirectoryForScanning directory, it is included in the github repository 
in the src folder.

The framework will then use that location to scan for
files and filter for VechicleRegList.xlsx, which the framework will use for checking the vehicle registration and other details.
